        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Biscuit dough</li>
            <li>White sugar</li>
            <li>Ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>Walnuts</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Heat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9- or 10-inch tube or Bundt
                pan. Do not use a two-piece tube pan with a removable bottom because the hot caramel
                sauce will run out and make a big mess. The biscuits will expand as they bake, so
                it's important to use a large enough baking pan to contain the biscuits and the
                sauce. It's better to use a baking pan that's a little too big than risk using a pan
                that's too small.
            </li>
            <li>
                Combine the white sugar and ground cinnamon in a sealable zip-top bag or in a large
                mixing bowl. Cut the canned biscuit dough into quarters and drop them into the bag
                or bowl. Shake the bag or toss the pieces in the bowl until they're separated and
                evenly coated. If you have cinnamon sugar left over, you can keep it in a jar for
                another use.
            </li>
            <li>
                Lift the biscuit pieces out of the cinnamon sugar and arrange them in the pan. If
                you're adding nuts and raisins, sprinkle them in as you go. Some home cooks like to
                start with a layer of nuts and raisins so they'll be on top when you invert the
                baked monkey bread, but that's optional.
            </li>
            <li>
                Place the margarine or butter and the brown sugar in a small saucepan and melt
                together over medium heat, stirring until combined. Bring to a full boil and let the
                mixture cook for 1 minute. Pour the warm sauce over the biscuits. It will seep down
                through the biscuits as the monkey bread bakes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Place the pan in the heated oven and bake for 35 minutes. Remove from the oven and
                let it rest for 10 minutes. After 10 minutes, place a large plate over the pan,
                protect your hands with oven mitts, and turn over the plate and the pan. Lift the
                pan straight up to let the monkey bread slide out onto the plate.
